    "section": "",
    "text": "I am a PhD student in ecotoxicology and environmental chemistry, investigating the toxicity of both untreated and advanced oxidation-processed nanoplastics and microplastics—whether alone or in combination with emerging co-contaminants—on aquatic organisms such as Daphnia magna and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Additionally, I manage data processing, visualization and produce visually engaging reports using Quarto."
