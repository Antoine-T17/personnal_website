I am a PhD student in **ecotoxicology and environmental chemistry**, investigating the toxicity of both untreated and *advanced oxidation-processed* nanoplastics and microplastics—whether alone or in combination with emerging co-contaminants—on aquatic organisms such as *Daphnia magna* and *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*. Additionally, I manage data processing, visualization and produce visually engaging reports using Quarto.
