    "text": "Working with the ZebraBox, I have been monitoring Daphnia magna behavior and, as a result, developed an automated pipeline for high-throughput analysis.\nWidely recognized as a popular model organism in toxicology, Daphnia magna is favored for its ease of laboratory culturing, large brood size, high sensitivity to pollutants, short generation time, and the diverse range of endpoints it offers in toxicity studies (Thakur and Kocher 2018; Pikuda et al. 2023). This versatility makes it an excellent candidate for studies on compound toxicity and environmental assessments.\nThe ZebraBox itself is a powerful tool, capable of performing high-throughput analysis on larvae and embryos of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as well as related species like Daphnia magna. It supports two primary behavioral assessment modes: a tracking mode for detailed locomotion analysis and a quantization mode for measuring overall activity. In tracking mode, the system follows the organism within a user-defined region of interest (ROI), enabling measurements such as traveled distance and duration of movement.\nMoreover, the system’s viewpoint feature facilitates different response modes, including:\n\nVisual response (light/dark)\nAuditory/sensory response (vibration/rest)\nPlace preference response\n\nThis multi-modal approach not only broadens the scope of behavioral studies but also provides researchers with a comprehensive toolkit for assessing the impact of various compounds on model organisms.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPikuda O, Dumont ER, Chen Q, et al (2023) Toxicity of microplastics and nanoplastics to daphnia magna: Current status, knowledge gaps and future directions.

    "text": "I am a PhD student in ecotoxicology and environmental chemistry, investigating the toxicity of both untreated and advanced oxidation-processed nanoplastics and microplastics—whether alone or in combination with emerging co-contaminants—on aquatic organisms such as Daphnia magna and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Additionally, I manage data processing, visualization and produce visually engaging reports using Quarto.\n\nWhat about my research ?\nSimply put, ecotoxicology is the study of how contaminants affect living beings, from the molecular level to entire ecosystems. To do this, I use organisms that I cultivate in the lab, expose them to contaminants, and observe what happens.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    Daphnia magna\n    \n      As a primary consumer in freshwater, Daphnia magna is transparent—ideal for observing morphological changes and pollutant sensitivity.\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\n    \n      At the base of the trophic chain, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii \n      is a primary producer. It is highly sensitive and grows rapidly, making it ideal for ecotoxicology \n      studies."
