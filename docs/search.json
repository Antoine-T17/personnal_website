    "text": "I am a PhD student in ecotoxicology and environmental chemistry, investigating the toxicity of both untreated and advanced oxidation-processed nanoplastics and microplastics—whether alone or in combination with emerging co-contaminants—on aquatic organisms such as Daphnia magna and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Additionally, I manage data processing, visualization and produce visually engaging reports using Quarto.\n\nWhat about my research ?\nSimply put, ecotoxicology is the study of how contaminants affect living beings, from the molecular level to entire ecosystems. Basically, I study just how far we’ve managed to throw nature off balance.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    Daphnia magna\n    \n      As a primary consumer in freshwater, Daphnia magna is transparent—ideal for observing morphological changes and pollutant sensitivity.\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\n    \n      At the base of the trophic chain, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii \n      is highly sensitive and grows rapidly, making it ideal for ecotoxicology \n      studies."
