Working with the ZebraBox, I have been monitoring *Daphnia magna* behavior and, as a result, developed an automated [pipeline](https://github.com/Antoine-T17/pipeline_zebrabox_treatment){target="_blank"} for high-throughput analysis.

Widely recognized as a popular model organism in toxicology, *Daphnia magna* is favored for its ease of laboratory culturing, large brood size, high sensitivity to pollutants, short generation time, and the diverse range of endpoints it offers in toxicity studies [@THAKUR-2018; @PIKUDA-2023]. This versatility makes it an excellent candidate for studies on compound toxicity and environmental assessments.

The ZebraBox itself is a powerful tool, capable of performing high-throughput analysis on larvae and embryos of zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) as well as related species like *Daphnia magna*. It supports two primary behavioral assessment modes: a tracking mode for detailed locomotion analysis and a quantization mode for measuring overall activity. In tracking mode, the system follows the organism within a user-defined region of interest (ROI), enabling measurements such as traveled distance and duration of movement.

Moreover, the systemâ€™s viewpoint feature facilitates different response modes, including:

- Visual response (light/dark)
- Auditory/sensory response (vibration/rest)
- Place preference response

This multi-modal approach not only broadens the scope of behavioral studies but also provides researchers with a comprehensive toolkit for assessing the impact of various compounds on model organisms.
